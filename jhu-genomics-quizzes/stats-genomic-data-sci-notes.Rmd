## Overview

This notebook reviews the three tables in genomics: the genomics data, the feature data and the phenotype data. It follows along with Statistics for Genomic Data Science on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-genomics/lecture/3K2XK/the-three-tables-in-genomics-in-r-3-46).

I load the data over a connection into the object `bodymap.eset`.

```{r}
con = url("http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/ExpressionSets/bodymap_eset.RData")
load(file = con)
close(con)
```

`bodymap.eset` is an `ExpressionSet` object.
